# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug
report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value
feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests
to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your
bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests
We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to
make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include
as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull
request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure
   someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your
   time to be wasted.

## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute
on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels
(enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any
'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
